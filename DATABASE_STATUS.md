## 📊 CURRENT DATABASE SCHEMA

### Files Table Structure
```sql
files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  original_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
  file_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### File Assignments Table Structure
```sql
file_assignments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  file_id UUID REFERENCES files(id),
  assigned_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  assigned_to_client UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### Profiles Table Structure
```sql
profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role user_role NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### Clients Table Structure
```sql
clients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  contact_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  contact_phone TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  client_admin_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

## 🔧 TYPESCRIPT INTEGRATION

### Schema Adapter
- ✅ `fileSchemaAdapter.ts` updated to match actual database columns
- ✅ Type definitions corrected in `types.ts`
- ✅ Mapping functions working between database and application layers

### Key Mappings
- Database `filename` ↔ Application `filename`
- Database `original_filename` ↔ Application `original_filename`
- Database `storage_path` ↔ Application `storage_path`
- Database `file_type` ↔ Application `file_type`
- Database `created_at` ↔ Application `created_at`

## 🎯 WORKING FEATURES

### ✅ Fully Operational
1. **User Authentication** - Login/logout with existing credentials
2. **File Upload & Storage** - Files can be uploaded and stored
3. **File Assignments** - Files can be assigned to clients
4. **Messaging System** - Internal messages between users
5. **News System** - Announcements and news distribution
6. **Role-Based Access** - Admin, client, user roles working
7. **Database Views** - Complex queries through views
8. **Row Level Security** - Data access properly restricted

### 🔄 Ready for Enhancement
1. **File Assignment Types** - Can be extended with additional columns
2. **File Versioning** - Structure ready for version tracking
3. **Access Logging** - File access can be tracked
4. **Advanced Permissions** - Fine-grained access control ready

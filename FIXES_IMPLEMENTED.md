# Critical Fixes Implemented - Production Ready Application

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to transform the application from a basic prototype into a robust, production-ready system. All critical errors have been addressed with enterprise-grade solutions.

## üîß PRIORITY 1: DATABASE SCHEMA INCONSISTENCY - FIXED ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Database schema used `name`, `original_name`, `file_path`, `mime_type`, `uploaded_at`
- Application code expected `filename`, `original_filename`, `storage_path`, `file_type`, `created_at`
- This caused critical runtime errors and data access failures

### Solution Implemented
- **Created Schema Adapter** (`src/utils/fileSchemaAdapter.ts`)
  - Provides seamless mapping between database and application interfaces
  - Includes type-safe conversion functions
  - Handles fallback values for missing data
  - Supports both directions (DB ‚Üí App, App ‚Üí DB)

- **Updated All File Operations**
  - Modified `useFileManagement.ts` to use adapter functions
  - Updated `useSimpleFileUpload.ts` with correct schema
  - Fixed all database queries to use proper column names

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Eliminated all schema-related runtime errors
- ‚úÖ Ensured data consistency across the application
- ‚úÖ Made the system resilient to future schema changes
